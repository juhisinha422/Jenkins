Today, I took my first step into the world of Jenkins — the most widely used open-source automation tool for CI/CD pipelines!


📦 𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽-𝗯𝘆-𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝗝𝗲𝗻𝗸𝗶𝗻𝘀 𝗜𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻

𝟭. 𝗗𝗼𝘄𝗻𝗹𝗼𝗮𝗱 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗮𝗱𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗝𝗲𝗻𝗸𝗶𝗻𝘀 𝗿𝗲𝗽𝗼𝘀𝗶𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆 𝗳𝗶𝗹𝗲
sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://lnkd.in/gW-nMmHm

This command fetches the Jenkins YUM repository file and places it in the appropriate directory so that yum can find and install Jenkins packages.

𝟮. 𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗝𝗲𝗻𝗸𝗶𝗻𝘀 𝗚𝗣𝗚 𝗸𝗲𝘆
rpm --import https://lnkd.in/gpsCNhT9

This imports the GPG key used to verify the Jenkins packages to ensure their authenticity and integrity.

𝟯. 𝗨𝗽𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺
sudo yum upgrade

This updates all installed packages to the latest versions available in your enabled repositories. It's good practice before installing new software.

𝟰. 𝗜𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗢𝗽𝗲𝗻𝗝𝗗𝗞 (𝗝𝗮𝘃𝗮 𝟮𝟭)
yum install fontconfig java-21-openjdk

Jenkins requires Java to run. This command installs the required Java runtime (Java 21 in this case) and fontconfig (required for Java GUI rendering, even if unused).

𝟱. 𝗜𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗝𝗲𝗻𝗸𝗶𝗻𝘀
yum install jenkins

Installs the Jenkins service using the Jenkins YUM repository.

𝟲. 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝗝𝗲𝗻𝗸𝗶𝗻𝘀 𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗰𝗲
systemctl start jenkins

Starts the Jenkins service so it begins running in the background.

𝟳. 𝗖𝗵𝗲𝗰𝗸 𝗝𝗲𝗻𝗸𝗶𝗻𝘀 𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗰𝗲 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝘁𝘂𝘀
systemctl status jenkins

Verifies that the Jenkins service is running properly. You should see "active (running)".

𝟴. 𝗩𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗳𝘆 𝗝𝗲𝗻𝗸𝗶𝗻𝘀 𝗜𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻
Open your web browser and visit:

http://<your-server-ip>:8080
http://3.108.42.24:8080

This will open the Jenkins dashboard. The first time you access it, Jenkins will prompt you for an administrator password.

𝟵. 𝗥𝗲𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘃𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗝𝗲𝗻𝗸𝗶𝗻𝘀 𝗶𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗮𝗱𝗺𝗶𝗻 𝗽𝗮𝘀𝘀𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗱
cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

Copy the password shown in the output and paste it into the Jenkins setup page to unlock the Jenkins dashboard.
